[My Notes](notes.md)

GrowLang, where you grow your language skills by growing a cute little garden! Learn a language by growing plants representing various grammar topics. By practicing your skills in an area, you water and grow the plant associated with that topic. Plants will dehydrate over time, so you need to review the matieral every so often to keep them fresh and watered.

Here is a sequence diagram for completing a lesson/watering a plant:

    User->>Server: Request lesson
    Server-->>User: Return series of questions
    User->>Server: Submit answers
    Server-->>User: Return lesson results
    Server-->>User: Update plant status (watering)
```

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to display garden of plants
- Ability to select and water plants by taking a language lesson corresponding to certain topics
- Ability to gain new plants by learning new topics
- Ability to display, answer, and submit various practice questions
- Ability to persistently store state of the plants
- Ability to persistently store learning progress

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for viewing garden, and one for language lessons.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, garden display, displaying questions, submitting answers, showing results, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
 - login
 - retrieving garden status
 - submitting answers to questions
 - retrieving lesson results
- **DB/Login** - Store users and their gardens in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't take lessons unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As time passes, plants can change their status as they dehydrate. These changes in status are sent to the user
