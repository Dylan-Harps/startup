[My Notes](notes.md)

GrowLang, where you grow your language skills by growing a cute little garden! Learn a language by growing plants representing various grammar topics. By practicing your skills in an area, you water and grow the plant associated with that topic. Plants will dehydrate over time, so you need to review the matieral every so often to keep them fresh and watered.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to learn a new language, but struggle to see any growth when you study? Try GrowLang, where by taking language lessons, you cultivate your own garden!

Just remember to water them regularly by taking time to review what you have learned! 

### Design

Here is a sequence diagram for completing a lesson/watering a plant:

```

### Key features

- Ability to persistently store learning progress

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for viewing garden, and one for language lessons.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, garden display, displaying questions, submitting answers, showing results, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
 - login
 - retrieving garden status
 - submitting answers to questions
 - retrieving lesson results
- **DB/Login** - Store users and their gardens in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't take lessons unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As time passes, plants can change their status as they dehydrate. These changes in status are sent to the user
